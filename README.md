# The next web (TNW) news page clone
This project was completed under Microverse remote software development curriculum. The replica of the page was built by pair programming while  putting emphasis on how it behaves on different sizes of the screen where the webpage is rendered. The developer tools was used to define the break points for the different screens.

Here's the screenshot of our work

Here's a <a href="https://raw.githack.com/imhilla/thenextweb/home-page/index.html">live link</a>

Here is how the page is structured:
The page is divided into three main sections as below;
- the header section which encloses the logo and the navigation. The navigation was achieved by using float and flex values for CSS display property on unordered lists and background images. Media queries were used to create headers for different widths on mobile, tablet and laptop. The bars in the header on mobile were created using CSS styles on three span HTML selectors. The header content on mobile is different from content on the tablet and laptop and this was achieved using media queries. A javascipt was used to switch between header1 and header2 upon scroll on tablet and laptop. The transition is ragged but attention due is paid.
- the main section which comprises of five sections that wrap articles. The articles were arranged mainly using grid and flex displays. The main section was created to render well on the mobile, tablet and laptop widths using media queries.
- the footer section comprises the navigation and copyright sections. These were styled to render well on mobile, tablet and laptop using flex display, grid display and position values in the specified media queries.
