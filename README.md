# thenextweb

In this project, we got the chance to build a responsive website. We cloned The Next Web, a tech-focused magazine which uses media queries to gracefully degrade their site as the window size is reduced. 


Here's the screenshot of our work

Here's a <a href="https://raw.githack.com/vanheaven-ui/website-heat-map/home-page/index.html">live link</a>

Here is how the page was structured:
The page is divided into three main sections as below;
- the header section which encloses the navigation. Navigation was achieved by using unordered list.
- the main section which comprises of six sections that wrap the articles and the side bars.
- the footer section
